# Italy is not for young people
<br /><br />
<span class="date">Date: 9th of September 2023.</span><br />

**48 years**.<br />
This is the average age of the italian population, as of today. There are more people going to retirement than school.<br /><br />

In this article we are going to analize which aspects of Italy make it difficult for young generations to hope for a better future. <br /><br />

## Schools...
The education system has suffered severe **budget cuts** in the last 20 years. As a result there are fewer (and poorly paid) teachers, and so each one of them is assigned to more students. <br /><br />

School buildings often suffer from a lack of maintainance. They are generally old and inaccessible to disable students.<br />
In my school there was even a lack of... **toilet paper**.<br /><br />

There are a lot of **expensive books** per school year.<br /> 
On average a school may have 6-7 different subjects, each having at least one text book and sometimes one exercise book. A single book may cost 30-50 euros.<br /> Every year you may end up spending 200-300 euros, that could become 1000-1500 euros for the five years of an elementary/high school, per each one of your children... <br /><br />

There is an high level of **school dropouts**.<br /> 
Italy ranks at the bottom positions in Europe for percentage of graduated students, as well as students with technological skills. More often than not newly graduated students struggles to find a job due to the **lack of practical knowledge**.
But this is just the tip of an iceberg.<br /><br />

## Job Market...
It is often called *Fuga di cervelli*, that is "**Brain drain**", or the common habit for a lot of young graduated people to **go abroad** to find better job opportunities.<br /><br />

Italy job markets is notoriously bad, with **low pay wages** and a lot of work hours.<br /> Most job offers demand for highly experienced workers, which is descouraging for younger generations. A "entry level position" for a software developer may require several months or few years of experience with a lot different technologies.<br /><br />

The vast majority of italian companies have small sizes, with around 10-50 employees. And so more often than not they cannot afford to train a complete inexperienced worker.<br /><br />

The work environment is often pretty bad.<br />
The majority of people in Italy **are not satisfied** with their jobs. Lots of women have experienced some kind of **sexual harassment**, and also they tend to be paid less than men. <br /><br />

## Politics...
There is a **lack of interess for (and from) politics**.<br /><br />

Few are voting because (young) people, more often than not, don't believe in politics. A lot of unkept promises, incompetency, inefficiencies in recent years have plumbed the trust of italians to politicians.<br />
And because of that, young people have less and less voice in command. **They count less**.<br /><br />

More often than not politics isn't even interested in young people related problems. As people are getting older speaking of retirement attracts more support than school or intership regulations. But how can we solve all of this?<br /><br />

## What is possible...
To summarize, Italy has a sctructural problem when it comes to its young generations.<br />
It is too costly to have kids and so couples simply cannot have them until lately in their 50s, if ever.<br /><br />

What Italy should do is probably increasing the investments on the education sector. At the time of writing this article, it destins only 4% of the GDP, while the EU average is about 4.8%.<br /> 
Those new investments should be used to increase the amount of teachers, as well as to modernize some of the oldest school buildings.<br />
But it isn't easy, since Italy has a public debt of 130-140% of the GDP.<br /><br />

Whatever counter-measure any italian government decides to apply there is the need to act quickly, otherwise Italy may collapse on its retirement system.

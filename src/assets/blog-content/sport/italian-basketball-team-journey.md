# Defeated but proud...
<br /><br />

<span class="date"> Date: 5th of September 2023 </span> <br /><br />
And at last Italy got defeated 63-100 to the USA. <br />

I've watched the Italian basketball team with a lot of joy during the 2023 FIBA World Cup, and once they reached the quarter-finals I would lie if I tell you that for a while I was thinking that Italy could have managed **to even reach the final**.<br />
But in the end Italy came short and team USA proved to be, as expected, a **far superior opponent**.<br /><br />

Nevertheless I believed that this can be still considered a good result. After all Italy ended up being among the top 8 best national teams in the competition, and they have lost against arguably the most favoured team to the final victory.

<br />

## Historically speaking... 
Before this match Italy has faced the USA in 14 official games, winning two of them.<br /> 
The most recent victory was back in ***august 2004**,  in a pre-Olymipic game in Barcellona, with the scoring of 95-78. In that olympics Italy will win the Silver medal, Argentina the Gold medal, and USA the bronze medal.

<br />

## What this lost mean...
Last time Italy reached the quarter finals was in 1998, **25 years ago**. This means that Italian basketball is gaining far more importance and becoming one of top spots in the world.<br />
But also that the road to the top is still too long.<br /><br />

Today **Simone Fontecchio** is the only italian playing in the NBA. And previously only three italians have ever played in the league, one of them was **Nico Melli** for the New Orleans Pelicans. <br /><br />

There is a lack of internationally good italian players. So, either italian basketball teams starts to get more italians in their teams to become competitive in the upcoming years, or we may never be able to repeat such an **epic deed**. <br />
Hope you enjoyed it!


See you!

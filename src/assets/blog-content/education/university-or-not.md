# To go or not to go...
<br /><br />

Maybe you have just finished high school, or maybe you already have some working experience. Whatever is your current situation you may have been asking yourself recently if the university is the right path for you or not. After all this is a big leap that will occupy the next years of your life.<br /><br />

Attending a University may cost **a lot of money** and you may not be able to afford it. It's not just the yearly enrollment, but also books and the travels.<br />
But undeniably a Bachelor or a Master degree can help on finding a **well paid job**. Nowdays a lot of entry-level working position requires either a degree or some previous working experience. 

<br /><br />

## Let's be clear...
If your ideal career path is to become a doctor or an engineer, or any field that requires **deep knowledge of math**, **physics**, or **medicine**, then it will almost certainly be out of your league if you don't have a Master Degree.<br /><br />

Overall, when it comes to scientific research, economics and finance, politics and law, the argument will likely be the same.<br />
The tech industry might be a bit more interesting.<br /><br />

### What about software development?

From direct experience, I can tell you that landing a job without a degree is possbile, but not easy. To be a software developer you still need to acquire a lot of knowledge of some programming languages and their design patterns. You also should know how Operating Systems and Computer Networks work, otherwise you may risk to have only a surface knowledge of your work.<br /><br />

And that's why I'm actually attending a university, because getting low-level knowledge of computers elsewhere is pretty hard or unconvinient.<br />
Another positive note of this choice is that I also got to learn the Java programming language.

<br />

## Pros...
Another aspect, maybe even more important than the previous one, is the **social advantage**.<br />
Atteding a university means staying in a class full of other students/people who probably could share your same passions or interests.<br /><br />

Some of your **most meaningful friendships**, or **working relationships**, may probably begin there.<br />
After all Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and a group of his friends, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, and they were all attending the Harvard University.<br />

Same thing goes for google and its founders Larry Page and Sergey Bin, both PhD students at the Standford University.

## Cons...
So all perks are good and yada, yada, yada, but it is not all gold everywhere...<br />
Other than being financially and/or time expensive, another reason why you may not go to the University is the **lack of practical knowledge** required by some companies.<br /><br />

Remember when I was talking about me attending the University? Well while I do infact know much more about Computer Science overall, but I don't get to write a lot of code if not on my own (like this exact website ðŸ˜€ ).<br />

And why luckily I already have some (working) experience, my peers are not that fortunate and they may still struggle more than me to get a job.<br /><br />

Another thing to consider is the **travel distance**. You may have to commute for even more than an hour to get on time for the start of the lesson, and to do that you may need to wake up early every day in order to achieve such a goal.<br />
But in the long run this situation can be **quite stressful** to a lot of people, because you may not get enough time to sleep, to stay at home with your family, or to spend some time with your friends.<br /><br />

Some people, in order to pay university fees, may have also to work while studying, which may not be a suitable solution for everybody.

<br /><br />

## My take...
If you can afford to go to the university then I would suggest to do that. Because it will be an important moment of cultural and human growth.<br /><br />
If you want to go to the university, but you cannot afford it, then you might have to do more sacrifices and either work while studying or keeping some money apart before the enrollment. 
<br /><br />
If you are not sure to go to the university, I suggest you either try to talk to those your friends who might already attend one and ask them why they decide to do that, or you may consider what you have been historically pretty good at and asking if you could see yourself in the future working with such skill(s).<br /><br />

I hope I have cleared some of your doubts and ease your decision, if not, well... sorry to waste your time... ðŸ˜¬<br /><br />

See you!

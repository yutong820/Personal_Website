# How did I get to this... 
<br /><br />
<span class="date">Date: 2nd of September 2023.</span><br />

I've never really been interested in programming until a 3 years ago... when a certain virus decided to escape from a lab in China and to freak up the world for a while.

Until then I had never written even a single line of code. The only thing related to programming was... playing games...<br>
But all of a sudden I had a lot of free time, and because I was stuck at home I got so bored that I decide to use a mobile app that teaches programming.

That app was already installed several months ago but only then I decided to use it for the first time... and that was the birth... of a new programmer.

<br />

## Sololearn...
Back in march 2020 I found myself wandering through its content, consisting on a variety of programming courses, such as Javascript, C++, or Python.

I didn't know what to pick and so casually I decided that HTML was the one to be selected... and that choice paid off well...

I remember going through the course with exciment after completing every section or quiz, and then I got the course certification, that you can see [here](https://www.sololearn.com/Certificate/CT-JEMFLG8Y/pdf).

<br />

## And then CSS and JavaScript...
So yes, after navigating through CSS with ease, JavaScript was my first programming language. (Yes I know, it's a scripting language...yada yada yada...)<br /><br />
I remember writing my first functions and even learning the JQuery library. I switched from making simple animations with HTML and CSS to try to replicate some small programs that actually have a porpuse.
<br /><br />
A small currency converter, replicating some websites, making even a small game... I became so proficient in a couple of months that I was convinced that maybe that could have been my career path.
<br />
I ended up the 2020 with new actual skills and a new found passion.

<br />

## But things got even better...
At the beginning of January 2021, I decided that maybe was time to try to get a job with my new learned skills.<br />
I thought that because I had no previous working experience that the best thing for me to increase my chances to get a job
was to directly show my works online.
<br /><br />
Back to the app I was using, another of its features was the ability to share a project of your own with other people using the same app, 
like Github (that I didn't know back then).<br />
Moreover, people can leave comments and approve projects made by others. And the most approved projects got to be listed in the top codes of the day.
<br /><br />
I had several ones getting over dozens of approvals with a lot of positive comments, so I thought that those could have been the best choices to show to companies on Linkedin.  
<br /><br />
And eventually... it did work.

<br />

## beSharp...
Oh yeah, my first day of work. I was excited knowing that for the next six months I would have had an intership with this company after 2 online meetings and last one on that office.
<br /><br />
Those six months were the best period of my life. I had amazing colleagues, amazing working enviroment, and many interesting tools to put my hands on. I was really keen on always coming to office and I was really passionate about what I was doing.
<br />
I worked as a Front-end developer for the company. They were expert on Cloud computing services, specifically AWS (Amazon Web Services).
But as for me, on practice, I got to use the piece of software that I become to love more and more... Angular.

<br />

## Computer Science...
At the end of the intership, my bosses suggest me that my best move should be to attend the university in order to go back to work in that company, and after a long thought process I decided to agree and to begin studying Computer Science.
<br /><br />
In my Bachelor journey I have gathered a lot of friends and I got to know more in depth how computers work. Concepts like Operating Systems, Algorithms, CPU became so much clear and my passion for programming became a passion for Computer Science.
<br /><br />
I got also to know more in depth Java, and I am surprise about much I ended up liking it.
<br />
In the upcoming last two academic semesters I will get to know how computers comunicate to each others and what are the foundations of the Internet!


<br />

## And now?
And now I am here, waiting to start my last bachelor year, creating from the ground up my personal website with the intent of mastering Angular so that I could be really proficient in a future working environment.
<br />
I thought that a blog was going to be the ideal project because it allows me to talk to what I like the most, and having a small space for me on the big sea of the Internet.
<br /><br />
Hope you enjoyed my first blog. See you!
